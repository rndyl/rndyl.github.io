					What the fox did you just foxing say about Melee, you little lynn? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class at Smash U, and I've been involved in numerous shine gimps on Armada, and I have over 300 confirmed ledge stalls. I am trained in fox on fox warfare and I'm the top wavecheater in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe your stocks out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, marth my foxing words. You think you can get away with saying that to me over the Internet? Think again, foxer. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spacies across the USA and your tech roll is being traced right now so you better prepare for my punish game, maggot. The combo that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your stock. You're foxing dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you with over seven hundred multishines, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in no items combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of MangoNation's wavecheats and fun cancels, and I will use them to their full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the stage, you little dingo. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your foxing tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price of the venue fee, you goddamn idiot. I will shine fury all over you and you will die in it. You're foxing dead, kiddo.

					Hello, I am currently 15 years old and I want to become a walrus. I know there's a million people out there just like me, but I promise you I'm different. On December 14th, I'm moving to Antartica; home of the greatest walruses. I've already cut off my arms, and now slide on my stomach everywhere I go as training. I may not be a walrus yet, but I promise you if you give me a chance and the support I need, I will become the greatest walrus ever. If you have any questions or maybe advice, just inbox me. Thank you all so much ~~

					I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Apache” and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

					Original, hand-crafted copypasta; The perfect present for a wedding, christening, new baby, birthday, anniversary, retirement, mother's day, thank you, school reunion - any occasion you can think of! Our copypastas are each individually handcrafted by a skilled and dedicated chef and guaranteed to be of the highest quality. These beautiful and decorative copypastas are hand-crafted from crushed and powered words bound up with only the finest pasta. Every copypasta is completely hand made, from the basic raw materials through to the finished product every process is carried out by hand. The only exception is a cleaning and polishing process in which the copypasta is put through special machines. Even these machines have been developed for particular use in the preparation of the copypasta, for, although the copypasta is quite durable, fine details such as noses, horses ear's, swords, daggers and flag staffs could be snapped of if treated too roughly. The National Association of Copypasta Chefs (NACC) is dedicated to protecting artists and crafters - their work, creativity and intellectual properties and marketing rights. I believe to keep the true work of the artist and copypasta chef alive we must act to promote and protect our art and craft.

				<b>
					What in Davy Jones' locker did ye just bark at me, ye scurvy bilgerat? I'll have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven seas, and I've led numerous raids on fishing villages, and raped over 300 wenches. I be trained in hit-and-run pillaging and be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas. Ye be nothing to me but another source o' swag. I'll have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye like never been done before, hear me true. You think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device? Think twice on that, scallywag. As we parley I be contacting my secret network o' pirates across the sea and yer port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon, weevil. The kind o' monsoon that'll wipe ye off the map. You're sharkbait, fool. I can sail anywhere, in any waters, and can kill ye in o'er seven hundred ways, and that be just with me hook and fist. Not only do I be top o' the line with a cutlass, but I have an entire pirate fleet at my beck and call and I'll damned sure use it all to wipe yer arse off o' the world, ye dog. If only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish wrath your jibe was about to incur, ye might have belayed the comment. But ye couldn't, ye didn't, and now ye'll pay the ultimate toll, you buffoon. I'll lay fury all over ye and ye'll drown in the depths o' it. You're fish food now, lad.
